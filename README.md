- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Laura
- ðŸ‘€ I work as a data scientist.
- ðŸŒ± At this time I am enrolled in UC San Diego [Machine Learning Engineering Bootcamp](https://career-bootcamp.extension.ucsd.edu/programs/machine-learning-engineering/) -> I want to learn how to set up machine learning as part of the data pipelines I develop, test the model, iterate and deploy in cloud-based services.
