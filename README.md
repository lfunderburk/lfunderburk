- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Laura
- ðŸ‘€ I work as a data scientist.
- ðŸŒ± In the next month I will complete my UC San Diego [Machine Learning Engineering Bootcamp](https://career-bootcamp.extension.ucsd.edu/programs/machine-learning-engineering/)
 - I learned how to use machine learning as part of the data pipelines I develop, test the model, iterate and deploy in cloud-based services. Check    out [my blog](https://lfunderburk.github.io/)! My capstone is a project that studies consumer trends for three kinds of vehicles: electric, fuel-only and hybrid. I will publish this by end of May.
