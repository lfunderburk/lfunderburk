- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Laura
- ðŸ‘€ I work as a data scientist.
- ðŸŒ± In the next month I will complete my UC San Diego [Machine Learning Engineering Bootcamp](https://career-bootcamp.extension.ucsd.edu/programs/machine-learning-engineering/)  My capstone is a project that studies consumer trends for three kinds of vehicles: electric, fuel-only and hybrid. I will publish this by end of May.
